    "### Introduction:\n",
    "The data set we are working on is the bank marketing data set. The bank we are analyzing is a Portuguese banking institution with data related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls). \n",
    "\n",
    "The classification goal for this project, is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit. A term deposit is a cash investment held at a financial institution. Your money is invested for an agreed rate of interest over a fixed amount of time, or term. Term deposits can be invested into a bank, building society or credit union (in our case the Portuguese banking institution).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data set includes: \n",
    "- age \n",
    "- job \n",
    "- marital\n",
    "- education \n",
    "- default \n",
    "- balance \n",
    "- housing \n",
    "- loan \n",
    "- contact \n",
    "- day \n",
    "- month \n",
    "- duration \n",
    "- campaign \n",
    "- pdays \n",
    "- previous \n",
    "- poutcome \n",
    "- \"y\" (where \"y\" is whether or not they got a term deposit)\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project we will look at all the variables and see how they relate to clients subscribing to a term deposit, and figure out how to best predict whether or not a client will subscribe a term deposit."
